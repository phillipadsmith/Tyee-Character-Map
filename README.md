# Character Map

First-pass as a simple "character map" for an upcoming story on [The Tyee](http://thetyee.ca).

## Current use cases

* Provide the reader with more context on who the "actors" are in a story
* Provide the editor with a way to add actors to the map easily

## Backlog

* Provide some more interesting ways to navigate the map (filtering by group, perhaps?)
* Provide a visual cue around the relationships between actors
